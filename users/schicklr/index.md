I am currently in my 2nd year as a Nuclear Engineering PhD student at Oregon State University.  My advisor is Todd Palmer.  In addition to being a PhD student, I am also a full-time employee of the Radiation Center at OSU.  My title is Reactor Engineer and I mainly perform analyses of our 1 MW TRIGA Reactor in order to optimize its capabilities.  I am also an NRC-licensed Senior Reactor Operator on our TRIGA.

## Research
My research involves studies on the Oregon State TRIGA Reactor.  I have performed burnup calculations to analyze fuel depletion/plutonium production.  I am currently analyzing the feasibility of adding an extra cadmium-lined in-core irradiation facility (CLICIT) to the OSTR to increase operating efficiency.  My PhD research will involve increasing the maximum license power of the OSU TRIGA from its current power limit of 1.1 MW.
